# PhoenixC2 - A C2 Framework for Red Teams - First Release

# Introduction
PhoenixC2 is a free & open source C2 framework for Red Teams. It is written in Python3 
and uses for it's REST API. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend.
This is the first release of PhoenixC2 and it is still in development, i would be very happy if **you** could help me to improve and extend PhoenixC2.

# Features
- [x] Modern Web-Interface
- [x] Built for Teams and Organizations (Multi-User)
- [x] Customizable (Plugins, Modules, Kits)
- [x] Easy to use
- [x] Easy to extend
- [x] Supports different languages (Python, Go, ...)

# Inspiration
When I started to learn about penetration testing and red teaming, I did not know, what Command&Control Frameworks were.
My Idea was to create a tool, which would allow me to control exploited servers, using a simple tcp connection and one main listener.

After about a week, I stumbled upon [Empire](https://github.com/BC-Security/Empire), while learning on Tryhackme and I was amazed by it. 
The Empire Framework was a big inspiration for PhoenixC2, it's architecture and it's features.

I started working on this project, because it combined my two passions: Backend Development and Penetration Testing and I could learn a lot about both.


# Comparison to other C2 Frameworks
PhoenixC2 is not a replacement for other C2 Frameworks, it is just another tool for Red Teams.
I tried to make PhoenixC2 as easy to use as possible, but it is still in development and there are still many features and bug fixes missing.

# Development
When I started working on PhoenixC2, it was just a small tcp server and client, which would be able to send and receive commands. But after time and lots of rewriting, PhoenixC2 has grown into a full featured C2 Framework.
I decided to open source PhoenixC2, because I think it is a good idea to share my work with the community and I would be very happy, if you could help me to improve this project.

# Future
I plan to implement several new features and improvements to PhoenixC2, with the ultimate goal of making it a valuable tool for professional Red Teams and hobbyists alike. Contributors with experience in areas beyond mine expertise will be very important in achieving this goal.
